Bringing you the magic of Pokémon, on Discord, right in the comfort of your home. 

The source code provided is purely for developmental purpose. We kindly ask you to use `@Pokecord invite` in a server with Pokecord to invite the bot to your own.

## Roadmap
*This roadmap is broad. For details, please review our dev channel via our Discord server.*

**1.** Various improvements to the project to make it easier to restart separate parts of the bot

**2.** Translations over the entire project could be made better (e.g., [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/))

**3.** "The project is too connected." Many parts are connected, but it's not obvious that they are. This makes it hard to make changes without changing a whole bunch of other things.
